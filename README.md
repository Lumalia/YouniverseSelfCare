# YouniverseSelfCare
 CatHacks 2023 Project
By: Sydney Schenk, Brenna Early, and Anastasia Myers

Overview of Youniverse:
Youniverse is a website that is used by people to prioritize mental health. This utilizes daily reminders and goals to incentivize self care activities. These activities are represented with cartoon planets in order to create a virtual environment that is inviting and makes users want to complete their mental health activities.

Plan for Future Implementations:
In the future, we would like to use time and date data in order to keep track of user progress on their self care journey. We would use this to show the streaks of days in-a-row to incentivise more usage of the app and better self care. We would also give the users an option of personalizing their self care activities. This would be important so that everyone could get the most out of their self care routines.

How we Decided on this Project:
We chose this project because mental health is an incredibly important issue. Poor mental health can impact your life in many ways, physically, socially and grade-wise. Statistically, engineering students are less likely to seek mental health help when compared to their peers. This is an issue because engineering students' poor mental health can affect their grades leading to more stress. This app aims to provide a simple outlet for stress for engineering students looking to make changes to their life. The space theme is meant to make an appeal to engineers in specific. However, this app can also be used for people other than engineers. We used a simple theme to make self improvement a little less intimidating. Along with the inclusion of an in-app "streak" to help users stay accountable with their self-love.
